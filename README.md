## ðŸ›  How It Works

Wingman provides a custom model WingmanSettings to store key-value pairs for your application settings. 
Additionally, the WingmanCacheManager manager allows caching of these settings, so you never need to hit the database 
unless necessary.

### Model: WingmanSettings
- name: A unique name for the setting (used as the key).
- value: The value of the setting, which can be any type.
- cache_expiry: Expiry time for the cached setting in seconds.
- description: Optional description for the setting.
- history: Automatically tracks changes to settings using simple_history.

### Manager: WingmanCacheManager

- **get_settings(name):** Retrieves a setting by its name, first checking the cache. If not found, it queries the database and caches the result for future use.
- **delete_settings(name):** Deletes the setting from the cache.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Creating Settings

You can create settings like so:

```
from wingman.core.models import WingmanSettings

setting = WingmanSettings.objects.create(
    name='FEATURE_TOGGLE',
    value=True,
    cache_expiry=3600,  # Cache expiry time in seconds
    description='Enables the feature toggle for the new feature.'
)
```

### Retrieving Settings

Retrieve settings using the ```get_value`` method:

```
from wingman.core.models import WingmanSettings

# Get the value of a setting
setting_value = WingmanSettings.get_value('FEATURE_TOGGLE')
```
